    3 Given an array of words, your mission is to filter out the words that are entirely uppercase. 
    4 If a word contains any lowercase letters, it should be excluded from the result. 
    5 Once you have filtered the words, you must present them to the result array.
    6 
    7 Note:You are not allowed to use any traditional loops such as for or while, or the forEach method.

    9 Input Format :
   10 --------------
   11 N space-separated words. 
   12 
   13 Output Format :
   14 ---------------
   15 A new array containing only the words that are entirely uppercase, suitable for the Uppercase array.
   16 
   17 Sample Input 1:
   18 ---------------
   19 KINGDOM Valley QUEEN castle
   20 
   21 Sample Output 1:
   22 ---------------
   23 ['KINGDOM', 'QUEEN']
   24 
   25 Explanation:
   26 ------------
   27 In this example, "KINGDOM" and "QUEEN" are entirely uppercase and are thus included in the array. 
   28 "Valley" and "castle" contain lowercase letters and are excluded from the array.
