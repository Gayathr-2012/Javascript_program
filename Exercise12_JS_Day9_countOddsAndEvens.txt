    2 Mr. Somanath, a mathematics teacher, wants to test his students' understanding of arrays and JavaScript functions. He has given them a task to implement a function called countOddsAndEvens that takes in an array of numbers. The function should return an object with two properties: odds and evens, representing the count of odd and even numbers in the array, respectively.
    3 
    4 The students are not allowed to use any traditional loops such as for or while, or the forEach method. They should use the reduce method to solve the problem.
    5 
    6 Write a function countOddsAndEvens that fulfills the requirements mentioned above.
    7 Input Format :
    8 --------------
    9 Line 1 : N space-separated numbers.
   10 
   11 Output Format :
   12 ---------------
   13 Line 1 : An Object with TWO properties
   14 
   15 
   16 Sample Input 1:
   17 ---------------
   18 9 3 7 6 8 1 10
   19 
   20 Sample Output 1:
   21 ---------------
   22 { odds: 4, evens: 3 }
   23 
   24 Explanation 1:
   25 -------------
   26 The array contains 2 even numbers and 4 odd numbers
